Euler's Method calculator & Visualizer

This program was made in collaboration with Jason Zingaretti for our Differential Equations course. 
The project assignment was to make a presentation regarding something with differential equations in the real world. 
Our presentation focused on the computer science simulations of differential equations and their applications on different 
fields such as physics.
